        You return to the group with the key. The cage containing Juan and the
        rest of the team lifts. The team rushes out of the cage, and passes you
        to the door. As you hold out the key, the group parts and you spot the
        door. You insert the key into the keyhole and turn. As the door unlocks,
        you push the heavy door open. Fresh air rushes past you and into the
        house. You and the team spill out into the street as you spot a figure
        strolling up the street to the house.

        “Hi everyone. You’re early for the Bitwise Haunted House!” Irma says, a
        smile plastered on her face as she points to the small “Bitwise
        Industries” sign just above the doorway.
