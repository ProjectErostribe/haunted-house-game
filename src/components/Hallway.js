                The team of apprentices hesitantly step into the hallway, looking around into the begrimed space. The door slams shut behind them, shaking the dust from the ceiling above.
            </p>
            <p>
                A booming voice from the rafters cackles “You’ve found my Haunted House! Welcome in, grab a chair, take a nap, but to leave you must find the silver key!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What was that?!” Habteab exclaimed.
                “Who said what about a key?” Garet says.
                “We still haven’t found out if they have Skittles…” Myles sighs, rolling their eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                 voice continues, “In front of you is a hall filled with doors. Each room has a challenge for you all to beat, one room holds the key. Complete the challenge, find the key and save yourselves before it’s too late. You’ve been volun-told to search the rooms for the key. Everyone else stays put.”
            </p>
            <p>
                    As you step forward, a large metal cage slams down around Juan and the rest of the group. A look of fear passes among the group.
            </p>
            <p>
                    “Remember” the voice pronounces “Nobody belongs here more than you!”
