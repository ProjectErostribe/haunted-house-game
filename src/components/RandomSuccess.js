//*************************/
//    Component goal
//************************/
// Using the 'selectRandom' function that has already been made
// Use this function along with the event actions to give the game chance!
// you need to identify the successful action and give that selection a chance to win or lose.
//**************/
//    IDEAS
//**************/
// Define 2 variables 'player' or 'npc'.
// Store a random number from the 'selectRandom' function into each of those variables.
// check to see which variable is higher.
// If 'player' number is higher the user wins the event
// If 'npc' number is higher the user loses the event
